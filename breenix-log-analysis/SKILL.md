# Kernel Log Analysis for Breenix

Search, analyze, and extract information from Breenix kernel logs for debugging and testing.

## Purpose

Breenix logs all kernel runs to `logs/breenix_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`. This skill provides patterns for searching these logs efficiently, finding checkpoint signals, tracing execution, and diagnosing issues.

## When to Use

- **Finding test signals**: Locate checkpoint markers like `ðŸŽ¯ KERNEL_POST_TESTS_COMPLETE ðŸŽ¯`
- **Tracing execution**: Follow kernel boot sequence or specific subsystem initialization
- **Debugging failures**: Find panics, faults, or error messages
- **Verifying behavior**: Confirm expected operations occurred
- **Performance analysis**: Check timing of operations via log timestamps

## Log Location and Format

```bash
# Logs stored in
logs/breenix_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log

# View latest log
ls -t logs/*.log | head -1 | xargs less

# View specific log
less logs/breenix_20250120_143022.log
```

### Log Format
```
[ INFO] kernel::memory: Physical memory: 94 MiB usable
[DEBUG] kernel::memory: Frame allocator initialized
[ WARN] kernel::process: No processes ready
```

Levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`

## Search Using find-in-logs Script

The `scripts/find-in-logs` tool searches recent logs:

```bash
# Create search query (avoids approval prompts)
echo '-A50 "Creating user process"' > /tmp/log-query.txt
./scripts/find-in-logs

# The script reads from /tmp/log-query.txt and searches logs
```

### Common Search Patterns

```bash
# Find panics
echo '-i "panic"' > /tmp/log-query.txt
./scripts/find-in-logs

# Find page faults
echo '-i "page fault"' > /tmp/log-query.txt
./scripts/find-in-logs

# Find context around checkpoint
echo '-A20 -B10 "KERNEL_POST_TESTS_COMPLETE"' > /tmp/log-query.txt
./scripts/find-in-logs

# Find process creation
echo '"Creating user process"' > /tmp/log-query.txt
./scripts/find-in-logs
```

## Direct grep Usage

```bash
# Find specific error
grep -n "ERROR" logs/breenix_20250120_*.log

# Find with context
grep -A10 -B5 "Double Fault" logs/breenix_20250120_*.log

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i "memory" logs/breenix_20250120_*.log

# Multiple patterns
grep -E "panic|fault|error" logs/breenix_20250120_*.log

# Count occurrences
grep -c "Timer interrupt" logs/breenix_20250120_*.log
```

## Common Checkpoint Signals

```bash
# Test completion
grep "ðŸŽ¯ KERNEL_POST_TESTS_COMPLETE ðŸŽ¯" logs/*.log

# Userspace execution
grep "USERSPACE OUTPUT:" logs/*.log
grep "Hello from userspace" logs/*.log

# System calls
grep "ðŸŽ‰ USERSPACE SYSCALL" logs/*.log

# Initialization checkpoints
grep "initialized\|INITIALIZED" logs/*.log

# Process creation
grep "Process created: PID" logs/*.log
```

## Execution Flow Tracing

### Boot Sequence
```bash
# Full boot trace
grep -E "Boot|GDT|IDT|PIC|Memory|Heap|Timer|Keyboard" logs/latest.log

# Memory subsystem only
grep "memory\|page table\|frame allocator" logs/latest.log

# Process subsystem
grep "process\|fork\|exec\|PID" logs/latest.log
```

### Subsystem Analysis
```bash
# Timer subsystem
grep -n "timer\|RTC\|tick" logs/latest.log

# Interrupt handling
grep -n "interrupt\|IRQ\|IDT" logs/latest.log

# System calls
grep -n "syscall\|sys_\|INT 0x80" logs/latest.log
```

## Error and Fault Analysis

### Finding Faults
```bash
# Double faults
grep -A20 "DOUBLE FAULT" logs/*.log

# Page faults
grep -A10 "PAGE FAULT" logs/*.log

# General panics
grep -B10 -A20 "PANIC" logs/*.log
```

### Error Context
```bash
# Find errors with context
grep -A15 -B5 "ERROR" logs/latest.log

# Find warnings that might indicate problems
grep -A5 "WARN" logs/latest.log
```

## Log Analysis Patterns

### Timeline Analysis
```bash
# Extract just log levels and messages for overview
grep -E "\[(INFO|WARN|ERROR|DEBUG)\]" logs/latest.log | less

# Filter to specific subsystem
grep "\[.*\] kernel::process:" logs/latest.log
```

### Success/Failure Detection
```bash
# Check if test completed
if grep -q "KERNEL_POST_TESTS_COMPLETE" logs/latest.log; then
  echo "Test completed"
else
  echo "Test did not complete"
  # Find last successful checkpoint
  grep "SUCCESS\|initialized\|completed" logs/latest.log | tail -10
fi
```

### Performance Markers
```bash
# Find timing information
grep -E "took|elapsed|ms|seconds" logs/latest.log

# Specific operations
grep "Context switch\|schedule\|preempt" logs/latest.log
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With kernel-debug-loop
```bash
# Run quick test
kernel-debug-loop/scripts/quick_debug.py --signal "TARGET_CHECKPOINT"

# Then analyze its output
grep "TARGET_CHECKPOINT" logs/latest.log
```

### With ci-failure-analysis
```bash
# Analyze CI logs
ci-failure-analysis/scripts/analyze_ci_failure.py target/xtask_*_output.txt

# Then search for specific patterns found
grep "PATTERN" target/xtask_*_output.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific patterns**: Narrow searches to relevant subsystems
2. **Add context**: Use `-A` (after) and `-B` (before) flags
3. **Check latest first**: `ls -t logs/*.log | head -1`
4. **Save search queries**: Use `/tmp/log-query.txt` for complex patterns
5. **Look for first error**: Often followed by cascading failures
6. **Check initialization**: Ensure subsystems initialized before use
7. **Verify checkpoints**: Confirm expected signals appear

## Summary

Effective log analysis requires:
- Knowing checkpoint signals
- Using grep with context flags
- Understanding log levels and formats
- Tracing execution flow
- Finding first failures
- Verifying expected behavior

Logs are the primary window into kernel behavior - use them liberally during development and debugging.
