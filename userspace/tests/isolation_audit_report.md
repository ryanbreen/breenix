# Breenix Process Isolation Implementation Audit Report

**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Prepared by**: Claude Code  
**For**: External Auditor Review  

## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation of process isolation testing in Breenix OS. While the infrastructure has been implemented according to specification, the end-to-end test is **NOT FUNCTIONAL** due to syscall dispatch issues. The isolation test fails to demonstrate memory protection between processes.

**Critical Finding**: The test-only syscalls (400/401) are not being recognized by the kernel, preventing the isolation test from executing correctly.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Successfully Implemented

1. **Page Fault Instrumentation** (kernel/src/interrupts.rs)
   - Added PID logging to page fault handler
   - Code verified to compile correctly
   - No page faults observed during test execution (expected behavior when test fails)

2. **Test Programs Created**
   - `userspace/tests/isolation.rs` - Victim process
   - `userspace/tests/isolation_attacker.rs` - Attacker process
   - Both programs compile and are included in the kernel binary

3. **Test-Only Syscalls** (kernel/src/syscall/handlers.rs)
   - `sys_share_test_page` (syscall 400)
   - `sys_get_shared_test_page` (syscall 401)
   - Protected by `#[cfg(feature = "testing")]`
   - Static atomic storage for page address sharing

4. **Kernel Test Integration** (kernel/src/test_exec.rs)
   - `test_process_isolation()` function added
   - Integrated into main kernel test flow
   - Creates victim (PID 3) and attacker (PID 4) processes

5. **No Regression in Existing Functionality**
   - hello_time.elf continues to work correctly
   - Evidence: "Hello from userspace! Current time:" appears in logs

### ❌ Not Working

1. **Test Syscalls Not Recognized**
   - Kernel logs show: `Unknown syscall number: 101`
   - Syscall 400 appears corrupted as large numbers: `18446683600570072824`
   - Dispatch mechanism not routing to test syscall handlers

2. **Isolation Test Fails**
   - Log shows: `✗ ISOLATION TEST FAILED: Attacker still running!`
   - No page faults triggered
   - Attacker process does not terminate as expected

3. **Test Programs Not Executing Correctly**
   - Partial output seen: `[ISOLATION] Victim process started, PID=`
   - Test syscalls never execute successfully
   - No evidence of memory sharing or access attempts

## Evidence from Kernel Logs

### 1. hello_time Still Works (No Regression)
```
Hello from userspace! Current time: [ INFO] kernel::syscall::handlers: USERSPACE OUTPUT: Hello from userspace! Current time:
```
**Verified**: Ring 3 execution continues to function correctly.

### 2. Isolation Test Processes Created
```
[ INFO] kernel::test_exec: === PROCESS ISOLATION TEST ===
[ INFO] kernel::test_exec: Expected result: PAGE-FAULT with attacker PID
[ERROR] kernel::test_exec: ✗ ISOLATION TEST FAILED: Attacker still running!
```
**Verified**: Test processes are created but test fails.

### 3. Syscall Issues
```
[ WARN] kernel::syscall::handler: Unknown syscall number: 101
[ WARN] kernel::syscall::handler: Unknown syscall number: 18446683600570072824
```
**Verified**: Test syscalls are not being dispatched correctly.

### 4. No Page Faults Observed
- Zero instances of "PAGE-FAULT: pid=" in logs
- Expected behavior when attacker never attempts memory access
- Page fault instrumentation cannot be verified as working

## Root Cause Analysis

The test failure appears to be caused by:

1. **Syscall Number Corruption**: The syscall numbers (400/401) are being corrupted or misinterpreted
2. **Dispatch Logic Issue**: The kernel's syscall handler is not routing to the test syscall implementations
3. **Possible ABI Mismatch**: The way userspace passes syscall numbers may not match kernel expectations

## Code Artifacts

### Page Fault Instrumentation (interrupts.rs)
```rust
// Get current PID for isolation testing
let current_pid = crate::process::current_pid().unwrap_or(crate::process::ProcessId::new(0));

log::error!("PAGE-FAULT: pid={}, rip={:#x}, addr={:#x}, err={:#x}",
            current_pid.as_u64(),
            stack_frame.instruction_pointer.as_u64(),
            accessed_addr.as_u64(),
            error_code.bits());
```

### Test Syscalls (syscall/handlers.rs)
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "testing")]
mod test_syscalls {
    static SHARED_TEST_PAGE: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
    
    pub fn sys_share_test_page(addr: u64) -> SyscallResult {
        SHARED_TEST_PAGE.store(addr, Ordering::SeqCst);
        SyscallResult::Ok(0)
    }
    
    pub fn sys_get_shared_test_page() -> SyscallResult {
        let addr = SHARED_TEST_PAGE.load(Ordering::SeqCst);
        SyscallResult::Ok(addr)
    }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Syscall Dispatch**: Debug why syscall numbers 400/401 are not being recognized
2. **Add Debug Logging**: Add extensive logging to syscall entry point to trace number corruption
3. **Verify INT 0x80 ABI**: Ensure userspace and kernel agree on syscall number passing convention
4. **Test Simpler Syscalls First**: Verify custom syscalls work before attempting isolation test

## Conclusion

While the implementation follows the specification, the test is **NOT FUNCTIONAL** and does not prove process isolation. The primary blocker is the syscall dispatch issue preventing the test programs from executing their intended logic. 

**Current State**: Infrastructure in place but not operational. No evidence of successful memory isolation testing.

**Risk Assessment**: Cannot verify that process isolation is working correctly. The page fault instrumentation cannot be tested until the syscall issues are resolved.
