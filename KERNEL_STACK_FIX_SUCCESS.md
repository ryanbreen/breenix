# Kernel Stack Mapping Fix - Success Report

## Problem Solved
We successfully fixed the critical kernel page table issue that was preventing CR3 switches to process address spaces.

## Root Cause
The kernel stacks at 0xffffc90000000000 were allocated ON-DEMAND via `allocate_kernel_stack()` AFTER the master kernel PML4 was built. This meant process page tables inherited a master PML4 that didn't have kernel stacks mapped, causing crashes on CR3 switch.

## Solution Implemented (Option B per Cursor guidance)

### 1. Pre-built Page Table Hierarchy
In `build_master_kernel_pml4()`, we now pre-build the entire page table hierarchy for the kernel stack region:
- Allocate PDPT for PML4[402] (kernel stacks at 0xffffc90000000000)
- Allocate PD entries 0-7 (covering 16MB)  
- Allocate PT for each 2MB chunk
- Leave PTEs unmapped (populated later by `allocate_kernel_stack()`)

### 2. Shared Kernel Subtree
- Process page tables copy PML4 entries from master, pointing to SAME physical PDPT/PD/PT frames
- This ensures all processes share the kernel page table subtree
- Verified by checking frame addresses match between master and process PML4s

### 3. Dynamic Stack Allocation
- `allocate_kernel_stack()` populates PTEs in the shared PT
- Uses `map_kernel_page()` which updates the master PML4
- All processes immediately see new stack mappings

## Results
```
✅ CR3 switch from 0x101000 -> 0x66b000 SUCCESSFUL
✅ Kernel stack at 0xffffc9000000e7a0 remains accessible
✅ No double fault after CR3 switch
✅ Process continues executing in new address space
```

## Evidence from Logs
```
CR3 switched: 0x101000 -> 0x66b000
After interrupts::without_interrupts block  
Setting kernel stack for thread 1 to 0xffffc90000022000
TSS RSP0 updated: 0x0 -> 0xffffc90000022000
Current CR3: 0x66b000, RSP: 0xffffc9000000f1a0
```

## Key Design Decisions (Following Cursor's Guidance)
1. **No placeholder frames** - Avoid Option A's complexity
2. **No GLOBAL on intermediate tables** - GLOBAL only applies to leaf PTEs
3. **No GLOBAL on stack pages** - Stacks are per-thread, not global
4. **Shared subtree, not copied** - All processes use same kernel page tables
5. **Local invlpg only** - No remote TLB shootdown needed for new mappings

## Next Issue
The kernel now hangs when trying to return to userspace via IRETQ. This is a separate issue from the kernel stack mapping problem, which is now SOLVED.

## Files Modified
- `kernel/src/memory/kernel_page_table.rs` - Pre-build hierarchy in `build_master_kernel_pml4()`
- No changes needed to `kernel_stack.rs` or `process_memory.rs` - they already work correctly

## Validation Status
This implementation follows Linux/FreeBSD patterns and Cursor's specific recommendations exactly.
