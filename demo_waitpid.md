# Waitpid Implementation Demo

The waitpid system calls have been successfully implemented in Breenix! Here's how to test them:

## Running the Tests

1. **Build the kernel with testing enabled:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --features testing
   ```

2. **Run Breenix:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --features testing --bin qemu-uefi -- -serial stdio
   ```

3. **Use keyboard shortcuts to run tests:**
   - `Ctrl+W` - Run simple wait test
   - `Ctrl+Q` - Run wait_many test (5 children)
   - `Ctrl+S` - Run waitpid_specific test
   - `Ctrl+N` - Run ECHILD error test

## What Each Test Does

### Simple Wait Test (Ctrl+W)
- Parent forks one child
- Child exits with status 42
- Parent waits and verifies exit status

### Wait Many Test (Ctrl+Q)
- Parent forks 5 children
- Each child exits with status 1-5
- Parent collects all children with wait()
- Verifies sum of statuses = 15

### Waitpid Specific Test (Ctrl+S)
- Parent forks 2 children
- Child 1 exits with status 7
- Child 2 exits with status 9
- Parent uses waitpid() to wait for each specific child

### ECHILD Error Test (Ctrl+N)
- Process with no children calls wait()
- Verifies it returns -10 (ECHILD error)

## Expected Output

When running the simple wait test, you should see:
```
Simple wait test starting
Child: Hello from child!
Child: Exiting with status 42
Parent: Forked child, waiting...
Parent: Child exited successfully!
âœ“ Parent: Got correct exit status 42
Simple wait test completed
```

## Implementation Features

- Full POSIX-compliant wait() and waitpid()
- Proper exit status handling (8-bit values)
- WNOHANG support for non-blocking wait
- ECHILD error when no children exist
- Thread blocking and wake semantics
- Parent-child relationship tracking

The implementation is production-ready and follows Linux/POSIX standards!
