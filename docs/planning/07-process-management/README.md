# Process Management Planning

This directory contains planning documents for process management in Breenix.

## Current Status
- Phase Status: âœ… COMPLETE (Basic implementation)
- Additional work in Phase 8: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

## Completed Features
- Process structure with lifecycle states
- Process ID (PID) allocation
- ProcessManager for tracking processes
- Integration with thread scheduler
- Process termination and cleanup
- Multiple concurrent process execution
- Process context saving/restoration
- Timer interrupt handling for userspace
- Keyboard responsiveness after process exit

## In Progress (Phase 8)
- fork() system call
- exec() family of system calls
- wait()/waitpid() for process synchronization
- Process priority and scheduling classes
- Process memory unmapping on exit
- Process resource limits

## Key Design Decisions
- Processes are collections of threads
- Main thread represents the process in scheduler
- Process ID allocation uses incrementing counter
- Process state machine: Creating â†’ Ready â†’ Running â†’ Terminated
- Parent/child relationships tracked for wait()
