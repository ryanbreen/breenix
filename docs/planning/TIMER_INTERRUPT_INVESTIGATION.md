# Timer Interrupt Investigation Results

Date: 2025-01-03

## Problem
The kernel was hanging immediately after enabling interrupts, preventing us from testing fork/exec functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Other OSes Do

**blog_os (Rust OS tutorial)**:
```rust
extern "x86-interrupt" fn timer_interrupt_handler(
    _stack_frame: InterruptStackFrame)
{
    print!(".");  // Just print a dot
    
    unsafe {
        PICS.lock()
            .notify_end_of_interrupt(InterruptIndex::Timer.as_u8());
    }
}
```
- Absolutely minimal work in handler
- No locks except for PIC EOI
- No scheduling decisions
- No context switching

**xv6**:
- Timer interrupt only increments ticks and wakes sleeping processes
- Context switching happens on interrupt return path
- Scheduling decisions deferred to return path

**Linux**:
- Timer interrupt handler must be minimal
- Cannot perform blocking operations
- Complex operations deferred to bottom halves

### What Breenix Was Doing Wrong

Our "minimal" timer handler was still doing too much:
1. Calling `timer_interrupt()` which acquires locks
2. Setting need_resched flag 
3. Calling complex scheduling logic on interrupt return
4. Attempting context switches inside interrupt handler path

Even this was causing hangs!

### Solution That Worked

Created `simple_timer.rs` with truly minimal handler:
```rust
extern "x86-interrupt" fn simple_timer_interrupt_handler(
    _stack_frame: InterruptStackFrame
) {
    unsafe {
        SIMPLE_TIMER_TICKS += 1;
        if SIMPLE_TIMER_TICKS % 10 == 0 {
            crate::serial::write_byte(b'.');
        }
    }
    
    unsafe {
        super::PICS.lock()
            .notify_end_of_interrupt(super::InterruptIndex::Timer.as_u8());
    }
}
```

This allowed the kernel to boot and reach the testing menu!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Interrupt handlers must be TRULY minimal** - Even simple operations can cause issues
2. **No complex logic in interrupt context** - Defer everything possible
3. **blog_os approach is correct** - Start with absolute minimum, add complexity carefully
4. **Lock acquisition in interrupts is dangerous** - Can easily cause deadlocks

## Next Steps

1. Keep simple timer for now to test fork/exec
2. Implement proper timer architecture:
   - Timer interrupt only sets flags
   - Context switching on interrupt return
   - Scheduling decisions outside interrupt handler
3. Follow FUNDAMENTAL_REDESIGN.md architecture
