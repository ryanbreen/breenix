# Next Steps After Page Table Fix

## Date: January 2025

## Current Status

We've successfully fixed the page table switching crash that was preventing fork/exec from working. The fork test now passes, creating child processes with proper memory isolation.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Verify Userspace Execution Actually Works

**Problem**: We can create processes via fork, but we haven't verified they actually execute userspace code.

**Tasks**:
- Create a simple test that schedules the forked child process
- Verify the child process runs and executes its code
- Add logging to confirm userspace instructions are being executed
- Test that both parent and child can run concurrently

### 2. Complete Exec Implementation

**Current Status**: Exec is 95% complete but hangs on BSS segment mapping.

**Tasks**:
- Debug why BSS (zero-initialized) segment mapping hangs
- The issue might be related to trying to map already-mapped pages
- Ensure exec properly clears the old process memory before loading new ELF
- Test exec with various ELF binaries

### 3. Build Userspace Test Programs

**Problem**: We need actual userspace programs to test with.

**Tasks**:
- Set up build system to compile userspace test programs
- Create simple test programs:
  - Hello world that prints via syscall
  - Fork test that calls fork() from userspace
  - Exec test that replaces itself with another program
- Package these as ELF binaries the kernel can load

### 4. Implement Basic Process Syscalls

**Required for Testing**:
- `wait()/waitpid()` - Parent waits for child to exit
- `getpid()` - Get current process ID
- `getppid()` - Get parent process ID
- `exit()` - Properly terminate a process

### 5. Fix Exec-After-Fork Pattern

**Goal**: Verify the common Unix pattern works:
```c
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    exec("/bin/program", args);
}
// Parent continues...
```

## Medium-Term Goals

### 1. Process Lifecycle Management
- Process state transitions (running, ready, blocked, zombie)
- Proper cleanup of terminated processes
- Parent notification when child exits

### 2. Memory Management Improvements
- Implement copy-on-write (COW) for fork efficiency
- Better physical memory allocation tracking
- Process memory limits and accounting

### 3. File System Integration
- Load programs from disk instead of embedding in kernel
- Implement basic file descriptors
- Support for reading program arguments and environment

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests
1. **Fork Chain Test**: Process forks multiple children
2. **Fork Bomb Protection**: Ensure system handles many processes
3. **Exec Stress Test**: Repeatedly exec different programs
4. **Process Tree Test**: Build complex parent-child relationships

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure fork latency
- Context switch overhead with many processes
- Memory usage per process

## Architecture Decisions

### Page Table Management
- Each process maintains its own `ProcessPageTable`
- Kernel mappings (PML4 256-511) shared across all processes
- Page table switches happen in assembly during interrupt return

### Process Isolation
- Complete virtual address space isolation
- No shared memory between processes (yet)
- Kernel accessible from all processes for syscalls

### Threading Model
- Current: One thread per process
- Future: Multiple threads per process sharing address space
- Need to separate Thread and Process concepts more clearly

## Success Metrics

1. **Fork Test Suite**: All fork-related tests pass
2. **Exec Test Suite**: Can load and run various ELF binaries
3. **Shell Implementation**: Basic shell that can fork/exec commands
4. **Stability**: System remains stable with 10+ concurrent processes

## Known Issues to Address

1. **BSS Segment Mapping**: Exec hangs when mapping BSS
2. **Process Cleanup**: Terminated processes not fully cleaned up
3. **Stack Allocation**: Each process needs unique stack regions
4. **TLS Management**: Thread-local storage for each process

## Next PR Focus

The next pull request should focus on:
1. Verifying userspace execution works
2. Fixing the BSS segment issue in exec
3. Adding basic process syscalls (wait, getpid, exit)
4. Creating integration tests for fork/exec patterns

This will give us a minimal but complete process management system!
