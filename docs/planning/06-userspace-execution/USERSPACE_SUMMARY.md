# Userspace Execution Summary

## What We Accomplished

We successfully implemented userspace (Ring 3) execution in Breenix! This is a major milestone.

### Working Features

1. **Ring 3 Transition**
   - IRETQ-based transition from kernel (Ring 0) to userspace (Ring 3)
   - Proper GDT setup with user code/data segments
   - TSS configured with kernel stack (RSP0) for interrupt handling

2. **ELF Loading**
   - Load and parse ELF64 executables
   - Map program segments with appropriate permissions
   - Handle read-only segments correctly

3. **System Calls**
   - INT 0x80 mechanism (Linux-compatible)
   - Working syscalls:
     - `sys_exit` (0) - Program termination
     - `sys_write` (1) - Write to stdout
     - `sys_get_time` (4) - Get system time
   - Proper register preservation across syscalls
   - Security check to ensure syscalls come from userspace

4. **Memory Protection**
   - User pages mapped with USER_ACCESSIBLE flag
   - Kernel memory inaccessible from userspace
   - Guard pages for stack protection

### Test Program Output

Our test program successfully:
```
Hello from userspace! Current time: 1455 ticks
```

Then calls `sys_exit(0)` to terminate cleanly.

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `/kernel/src/elf.rs` - ELF64 loader
- `/kernel/src/syscall/entry.asm` - Syscall entry point
- `/kernel/src/syscall/handler.rs` - Syscall frame handling
- `/kernel/src/task/userspace_switch.rs` - Ring 3 transition
- `/kernel/src/userspace_test.rs` - Userspace testing framework
- `/userspace/tests/hello_time.rs` - Test userspace program

**Removed Files:**
- `/kernel/src/userspace_jump.asm` - Unused early attempt

### What Was Fixed Since Initial Implementation

1. **SWAPGS** - ✅ Now working with proper MSR setup
2. **sys_exit** - ✅ Proper cleanup and scheduler integration
3. **Scheduler integration** - ✅ Processes run as scheduled tasks
4. **Multi-process** - ✅ Multiple concurrent processes supported

All initial limitations have been addressed!

### Architecture

```
Memory Layout:
0x1000_0000 - Userspace program load address (256 MB)
0x5555_5555_4000 - Userspace stack (grows down)

Selectors:
0x08 - Kernel code (Ring 0)
0x10 - Kernel data (Ring 0)  
0x18 - TSS
0x2b - User data (Ring 3)
0x33 - User code (Ring 3)
```

## Status

This phase is **COMPLETE**. All userspace execution features work:
- Ring 3 execution
- ELF loading
- System calls
- Process/scheduler integration
- SWAPGS support

Next work is in Phase 8: Enhanced Process Control (fork/exec/wait)
