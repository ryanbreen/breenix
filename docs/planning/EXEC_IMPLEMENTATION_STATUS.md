# Exec Implementation Status - Session Handoff

**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Current Status:** Step 1 of exec roadmap completed, but critical page table bug causes system reboot

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### âœ… Step 1: Fixed ELF Loading Architecture
1. **Removed dangerous page table switching** from `load_segment_into_page_table()` in `/kernel/src/elf.rs`
   - Changed from switching to process page table during loading (caused crashes)
   - Now uses Linux-style physical memory access via `crate::memory::physical_memory_offset()`
   - Kernel stays in kernel address space throughout ELF loading

2. **Fixed post-exec scheduling hang** in `/kernel/src/process/manager.rs:499-503`
   - Added exec'd process back to ready queue after exec completes
   - Eliminated infinite scheduling loop

3. **Partially fixed stack mapping issue** in `/kernel/src/process/manager.rs:444-482`
   - Discovered exec was creating stack in kernel page table, not process page table
   - Added manual stack page mapping into new process page table
   - Stack is now accessible in the exec'd process address space

## Current Critical Bug

### ðŸš¨ System Reboots When Exec'd Process Runs

**Symptoms:**
```
1751656254 - [TRACE] kernel::interrupts::context_switch: Scheduled page table switch for process 1 on return
[2J[01;01H[=3h[2J[01;01H... (UEFI bootloader messages - SYSTEM REBOOTED!)
```

**What happens:**
1. exec() completes successfully
2. Process is added to scheduler
3. Context switch prepares to run the exec'd process
4. **IMMEDIATE REBOOT** when switching to the new process page table

**This indicates:** Triple fault due to page table issues

## Root Cause Analysis

The exec'd process page table is missing critical mappings or has corruption. Possible causes:

1. **GDT/TSS Not Mapped**: The new page table might not have access to GDT/TSS
2. **Interrupt Handlers Not Accessible**: IDT or interrupt handler code not mapped
3. **Stack Mapping Bug**: Our manual stack mapping might be incorrect
4. **Kernel Code/Data Missing**: Despite copying PML4 entries 256-511, something critical is missing

## Code Changes Made

### 1. `/kernel/src/elf.rs` - Linux-style ELF Loading
```rust
// OLD: Dangerous page table switching
unsafe {
    switch_to_process_page_table(page_table);
}
// ... load data ...
unsafe {
    switch_to_kernel_page_table();
}

// NEW: Physical memory access
let physical_memory_offset = crate::memory::physical_memory_offset();
let frame_phys_addr = frame.start_address();
let phys_ptr = (physical_memory_offset.as_u64() + frame_phys_addr.as_u64()) as *mut u8;
// Write directly to physical memory
```

### 2. `/kernel/src/process/manager.rs` - Stack Mapping Fix
```rust
// Added manual stack mapping into new process page table
for page in Page::range_inclusive(start_page, end_page) {
    let frame = allocate_frame()?;
    new_page_table.map_page(page, frame, USER_ACCESSIBLE | WRITABLE | PRESENT)?;
}
```

### 3. `/kernel/src/process/manager.rs` - Scheduling Fix
```rust
// Add process back to ready queue after exec
if !self.ready_queue.contains(&pid) {
    self.ready_queue.push(pid);
}
```

## Next Steps for Debugging

### 1. Verify Page Table Contents
- Dump the new page table entries to verify kernel mappings
- Check if GDT/TSS/IDT addresses are accessible
- Verify stack is mapped at the correct address

### 2. Add Debug Logging
- Log CR3 value before/after switch
- Log page faults if they occur
- Add early fault handlers to catch issues before triple fault

### 3. Check Critical Kernel Structures
```rust
// Need to verify these are accessible from new page table:
// - GDT at 0x13a000 (or wherever it is)
// - TSS 
// - IDT and interrupt handlers
// - Kernel stack for interrupt handling
```

### 4. Test Simpler Exec Scenario
- Try exec with minimal ELF that just loops
- Verify page table switching works for simpler cases

## Key Files to Examine Next Session

1. `/kernel/src/memory/process_memory.rs` - How kernel mappings are copied
2. `/kernel/src/interrupts/context_switch.rs` - Where page table switch happens
3. `/kernel/src/gdt.rs` - GDT location and setup
4. `/kernel/src/process/manager.rs:440-490` - The exec implementation

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start MCP environment
tmuxinator start breenix-mcp

# Build with testing
cargo build --features testing

# Run exec test
# In MCP: exectest
```

## Summary

We've made significant progress - exec() now completes without hanging, and we've implemented proper Linux-style ELF loading. However, the exec'd process causes an immediate system reboot when its page table is activated, indicating missing critical mappings in the new page table.

The next session should focus on debugging why the page table switch causes a triple fault, likely by examining what kernel structures need to be mapped but aren't.
