# Breenix OS Project Roadmap

This is the master project roadmap for Breenix OS. It consolidates all existing documentation and provides a unified view of completed work and future goals. This document is actively maintained and referenced during development.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE ðŸš¨

**BREENIX IS NOT A TOY - WE BUILD FOR THE LONG HAUL**

Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** are we allowed to choose "easy" workarounds that deviate from standard OS development practices. When faced with a choice between:
- **The "hard" way**: Following proper OS design patterns used in Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
- **The "easy" way**: Quick hacks or workarounds that avoid complexity

**We ALWAYS choose the hard way.** This is a real operating system project, not a prototype. Every design decision must be made with production-quality standards in mind. This includes:
- Page table switching during exec() (OS-standard practice)
- Proper copy-on-write fork() implementation
- Standard syscall interfaces and semantics
- Real virtual memory management
- Proper interrupt and exception handling

**If it's good enough for Linux, it's the standard we follow.**

## Current Development Status

### Currently Working On (January 14 2025)

- ðŸš§ **Phase 4B**: Building Syscall Infrastructure
  - Syscall dispatch table (4B-1)
  - sys_write for userspace printf (4B-2)
  - sys_exit for clean termination (4B-3)
  - Following narrow PR approach: one syscall, one test, one merge

### Recently Completed (Last Sprint) - January 2025

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 4A COMPLETE: INT 0x80 Syscall Gate Working!** (Jan 14 2025)
  - **Tagged**: v0.3-syscall-gate-ok
  - **Problem Solved**: Userspace execution hanging at CR3 switch
  - **Root Causes Fixed**:
    - Kernel stack not mapped in process page table (fixed PML4 entry 2)
    - Kernel code not mapped in process page table (fixed PML4 entry 0)
  - **Key Achievements**:
    - INT 0x80 successfully fires from userspace with DPL=3
    - Syscall handler receives control with test value RAX=0x1234
    - Integration test `integ_syscall_gate` passes consistently
    - Guard-rail tests documented to prevent regressions
  - **Technical Details**:
    - IDT[0x80] set to privilege level 3 for user access
    - Both kernel mappings remain non-USER accessible (maintaining isolation)
    - Systematic debugging with INT3 test revealed execution issues
  - **Evidence**: Logs show "SYSCALL_ENTRY: Received syscall from userspace!" and "TEST_MARKER: SYSCALL_OK"

### Recently Completed (Previous Sprints) - July 2025

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ ACHIEVED ZERO COMPILER WARNINGS!** (Jul 11 2025)
  - **Starting Point**: 85+ compiler warnings cluttering the build output
  - **Goal**: Completely clean compilation with zero warnings
  - **Approach**: Systematic cleanup without breaking functionality
  - **Key Changes**:
    - Removed ~2,500 lines of dead code (unused functions, modules)
    - Fixed all conditional compilation issues with proper #[cfg] blocks
    - Resolved unreachable code warnings in syscall handlers
    - Added #[allow(dead_code)] only for legitimate future APIs
    - Fixed a critical userspace execution regression during cleanup
  - **Result**:
    - âœ… Zero compiler warnings - completely clean build
    - âœ… All tests pass, including critical multiple_processes test
    - âœ… Improved code clarity and maintainability
    - âœ… Better separation between testing and production code
  - **Evidence**: `cargo build` produces no warnings, all functionality preserved

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ SOLVED KERNEL STACK ISOLATION ISSUE!** (Jul 9 2025)
  - **Root Cause**: Kernel stacks were mapped per-process, causing double faults during page table switches
  - **Problem**: When switching page tables in timer interrupt, kernel was still on current thread's stack
  - **Solution**: Implemented production-grade global kernel page table architecture:
    - **Global kernel PDPT**: All PML4 entries 256-511 point to shared kernel_pdpt
    - **O(1) kernel mappings**: New map_kernel_page() API makes mappings instantly visible to all processes
    - **Bitmap stack allocator**: Kernel stacks at 0xffffc900_0000_0000 with 8KB stacks + 4KB guard pages
    - **Per-CPU emergency stacks**: IST[0] uses per-CPU stacks at 0xffffc980_xxxx_xxxx
  - **Result**:
    - âœ… Multiple concurrent processes run without double faults
    - âœ… Both hello_time processes execute successfully
    - âœ… Clean exits with code 0
    - âœ… Context switches work perfectly between processes
  - **Evidence**: Logs show "Hello from userspace!" from both processes, no double faults

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ FIXED USERSPACE EXECUTION!** (Jul 7 2025)
  - **Root Cause**: Process page tables missing critical kernel mappings
  - **Issue**: Timer interrupt handler crashed after switching to process page table
  - **Solution**: Copy ALL kernel-only PML4 entries (those without USER_ACCESSIBLE flag)
  - **Result**:
    - âœ… Userspace processes now execute successfully
    - âœ… "Hello from userspace!" messages print with timestamps
    - âœ… System calls work (exit syscall completes successfully)
    - âœ… Multiple concurrent processes run without conflicts
  - **Evidence**: Logs show all 3 hello_time processes executed and exited cleanly

- âœ… **Fixed Scheduler Not Running User Threads** (Jul 7 2025)
  - **Issue**: Timer interrupt waited for full quantum (10 ticks) before scheduling user threads
  - **Solution**: Modified timer interrupt to immediately set need_resched when user threads exist
  - **Result**: Scheduler now properly schedules threads 1, 2, 3, 4 in round-robin fashion
  - **Evidence**: Logs show successful context switches between all user threads

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ BREAKTHROUGH: Complete Page Table Isolation Implementation!** (Jul 7 2025)
  - **FIXED: "PageAlreadyMapped" error preventing multiple concurrent processes**
    - Root cause: All processes shared L3 page tables, causing conflicts on second process creation
    - Solution: Implemented selective deep page table copying for proper process isolation
    - Architecture: Each process gets independent L3/L2/L1 tables (OS-standard approach)
    - Performance: Only essential kernel mappings copied (first 16MB), avoids bootloader huge page overhead
    - Result: âœ… Multiple processes can be created without conflicts
  - **ACHIEVED: Proper OS-Standard Page Table Architecture**
    - âœ… Kernel space entries (256+): Shared safely between processes
    - âœ… Essential low memory (entry 0): Deep copied selectively for isolation
    - âœ… Other user space entries: Clean address spaces for each process
    - âœ… No "PageAlreadyMapped" errors in latest kernel runs
    - âœ… Context switching works between multiple processes
    - Evidence: Logs confirm process 1 and 2 created successfully with isolated page tables

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE: Fork+Exec Pattern FULLY FUNCTIONAL!** (Jul 7 2025)
  - **FIXED: Critical Timer Interrupt #1 Deadlock**
    - Root cause: Logger timestamp calculation calling time functions during interrupt context
    - Solution: Temporarily disabled timestamp logging during interrupt context
    - Result: âœ… Timer interrupts now work perfectly, kernel runs userspace processes
  - **FIXED: ProcessPageTable.translate_page() Bug**
    - Was returning None for ALL userspace addresses due to incorrect offset
    - Fixed by using frame allocator's physical memory offset
    - Result: âœ… Parent process can access memory after fork
  - **ACHIEVED: Complete Fork+Exec Implementation**
    - âœ… Fork system call works correctly (parent gets PID, child gets 0)
    - âœ… Fork test program executes from userspace and calls fork()
    - âœ… Child process successfully calls exec() to load hello_time.elf
    - âœ… "Hello from userspace!" prints from exec'd process
    - âœ… Fixed userspace address validation to accept stack range
    - Evidence: Logs show complete forkâ†’execâ†’output chain working

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Direct Userspace Execution FULLY WORKING!** (Jul 6 2025)
  - **FIXED: Double Fault on int 0x80 from Userspace**
    - Root cause: Kernel stack not mapped in userspace page tables
    - Ring 3 â†’ Ring 0 transitions failed when accessing unmapped kernel stack
    - Solution: Added `copy_kernel_stack_to_process()` to map kernel stack in process page tables
    - Result: âœ… Userspace programs can now successfully call `int 0x80` and make syscalls
    - Evidence: "Hello from userspace!" output with successful syscall completion
  - **MANDATORY REGRESSION TEST ESTABLISHED**
    - Direct execution test (`test_direct_execution()`) MUST pass on every kernel boot
    - Located in `kernel/src/test_exec.rs` - validates core syscall functionality
    - Success criteria: Must see "ðŸŽ‰ USERSPACE SYSCALL" and "Hello from userspace!" output
    - **CRITICAL**: No fork/exec work until this test consistently passes

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR EXEC PROGRESS: Fixed Multiple Critical Issues!** (Jul 5 2025)
  - **FIXED: Interrupt Preemption Issue**
    - Process creation was being interrupted, leaving system in inconsistent state
    - Added `without_interrupts` to `create_user_process` for atomic operation
    - Result: Process creation now completes successfully
  - **FIXED: User Mapping Inheritance Bug**
    - New page tables were copying user process mappings from kernel page table
    - Modified `ProcessPageTable::new()` to skip entries with USER_ACCESSIBLE flag
    - Result: No more "PageAlreadyMapped" errors during exec
  - **FIXED: TLB Flush Hang**
    - TLB flush now completes successfully (was hanging at line 159)
    - Process successfully loads ELF and attempts to run
  - **DEBUGGING APPROACH**:
    - Identified issue wasn't TLB flush itself but process being interrupted
    - Deleted obsolete TLB_FLUSH_HANG_ANALYSIS.md as issue was resolved
  - **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `/kernel/src/process/creation.rs` - interrupt protection
    - `/kernel/src/memory/process_memory.rs` - skip user mappings

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Page Table Switching Crash FIXED!** (Jul 4 2025)
  - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Bootloader maps kernel at 0x10000064360 (PML4 entry 2), not traditional kernel space
  - **PROBLEM**: Previous code only copied PML4 entry 256, missing actual kernel code location
  - **SOLUTION**: Comprehensive fix copies ALL kernel PML4 entries (found 9 vs previous 1)
  - **RESULT**: No more immediate crashes/reboots during page table operations
  - **EVIDENCE**: Exec test now progresses through first ELF segment successfully
  - **FILES MODIFIED**: `/kernel/src/memory/process_memory.rs` - comprehensive kernel mapping strategy

- âœ… **Context Switch Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical userspace execution issues (Jul 4 2025)
  - Added SWAPGS handling to timer interrupt for proper kernel/user transitions
  - Fixed RFLAGS initialization (must have bit 1 set: 0x202 not 0x200)
  - Discovered exec() was hanging due to interrupt deadlock
  - Fixed test code to use with_process_manager() to prevent deadlocks

- âœ… **Exec() Step 1**: Implemented Linux-style ELF loading with physical memory access (Jul 4 2025)
  - No more page table switching during ELF loading
  - Fixed post-exec scheduling hang
  - Discovered and partially fixed stack mapping issue

- âœ… **ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE: Fork() System Call FULLY WORKING!**
  - Implemented complete Unix-style fork() with proper process duplication
  - Full memory copying between parent and child processes (65KB stacks)
  - Process isolation via separate ProcessPageTables for each process
  - Correct fork semantics: parent gets child PID, child gets 0
  - Fixed critical interrupt handling deadlock with try_manager() in interrupt contexts
  - Fixed ProcessPageTable.map_page hang by switching to GlobalFrameAllocator

- âœ… **MAJOR**: Fixed per-process virtual address space isolation (previous sprint)
  - Created ProcessPageTable for complete memory isolation between processes
  - Implemented load_elf_into_page_table() for process-specific ELF loading
  - Added automatic page table switching during context switches


### Completed - Page Table Isolation Architecture

- âœ… **SOLVED: Complete Page Table Isolation Implementation**
  - **The OS-Standard Solution Implemented**: Each process gets independent page tables
  - **Architecture**:
    - **Kernel space (PML4 entries 256+)**: Shared safely between processes
    - **Entry 0 (low memory)**: Selectively deep copied (only essential kernel mappings)
    - **Other entries**: Clean address spaces for isolation
  - **Performance Optimized**: Only copies first 16MB containing kernel code, skips bootloader huge pages
  - **Result**: âœ… No more "PageAlreadyMapped" errors, multiple processes can coexist
       - Map out current PML4 entry usage

    2. **Deep Copy Implementation**:
       - When creating new process, allocate fresh L4 table
       - For kernel entries (256-511), must deep copy:
         - Allocate new L3 tables (don't share!)
         - Copy L3 entries, allocating new L2 tables
         - Only share L1 entries (actual physical pages)
       - For user entries (0-255), start empty

    3. **Fix Current Bug**:
       - Current code just copies PML4 entries (shares L3 tables)
       - Must implement recursive copying to create isolated tables
       - This is why second process gets "already mapped" errors

    4. **Why This Is The Only Correct Solution**:
       - **Security**: Process isolation is fundamental to OS security
       - **Stability**: Shared tables mean one process can corrupt another
       - **Standards**: Every production OS uses this approach (Linux, BSD, Windows)
       - **No Shortcuts**: Any "workaround" violates our core principle

  - **Expected Outcome**:
    - Each process has completely independent page tables
    - Multiple processes can load code at the same virtual address
    - True memory isolation between processes
    - Foundation for proper security and stability

### Recently Completed (This Session) - July 7, 2025

- âœ… **Fixed ProcessPageTable.translate_page() Bug**
  - **DISCOVERED**: ProcessPageTable was fundamentally broken
    - translate_page() returned None for ALL userspace addresses
    - Root cause: Incorrect physical offset calculation
    - Fixed by using frame allocator's physical offset
  - **RESULT**: Parent process can now access memory after fork

- âœ… **Fork+Exec Integration Successfully Implemented**
  - **IMPLEMENTED: sys_exec syscall wrapper in userspace**
    - Added SYS_EXEC constant (11) to libbreenix.rs
    - Added syscall2 function for 2-argument syscalls
    - Added sys_exec wrapper function: `sys_exec(path: &str, args: &str) -> u64`

  - **IMPLEMENTED: Fork test integration with exec**
    - Modified fork_test.rs to exec hello_time.elf in child process
    - Child process now calls `sys_exec("/userspace/tests/hello_time.elf", "")`
    - Parent process continues with original iterations
    - Architecture follows standard Unix fork+exec pattern

- âœ… **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Fork Test Was Already Working!**
  - **EVIDENCE**: Found working execution in focused_run.log:
    - âœ… Userspace execution: "Before fork - PID: 2" printed from Ring 3
    - âœ… Fork syscall: "Calling fork()..." from userspace (CS=0x33, RIP=0x100000ea)
    - âœ… Fork success: Parent PID 2 created child PID 3 successfully
    - âœ… Memory isolation: Proper page table copying and process separation
    - âœ… Process states: Both parent and child processes executing correctly

### Previously Working On - July 7, 2025

- ðŸš§ **CRITICAL: Page Fault in copy_from_user Function**
  - **Current Status**: Fork works but parent process crashes when accessing userspace memory
  - **Evidence from focused_run.log**:
    - Fork completed successfully (parent PID 2, child PID 3)
    - Parent tried sys_write with buf_ptr=0x10001082, count=33
    - Page fault in copy_from_user at address 0x10001082
    - Error: PAGE FAULT with ErrorCode(0x0) - read access to unmapped page
  - **Root Cause**: copy_from_user page table switching has memory access issue
  - **Impact**: Prevents fork test from completing and printing exec output

- ðŸš§ **CRITICAL: Scheduler Not Executing Processes in Recent Runs**
  - **Evidence**: Recent manual test created processes but no userspace execution
  - **What Works**: Process creation, scheduling infrastructure, timer interrupts
  - **What Fails**: Processes added to ready queue but never switched to
  - **Difference**: Earlier focused_run.log showed working execution, recent runs don't
  - **Investigation Needed**: Scheduler decision-making or context switching regression

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Userspace Features**
   - Implement wait()/waitpid() system calls for process synchronization
   - Add process exit status collection
   - Parent-child relationship tracking

2. **Shell Development**
   - Create basic shell that can fork+exec commands
   - Command parsing and execution
   - Built-in commands (cd, exit, etc.)

3. **Memory Management Enhancements**
   - Implement mmap/munmap for dynamic memory allocation
   - Add brk/sbrk for heap management
   - Copy-on-write (COW) page optimization for fork()

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Profile context switching overhead
   - Optimize TLB flushing strategies
   - Implement lazy FPU state saving


**CURRENT STATUS:**
```
âœ… BREAKTHROUGH: Direct userspace execution FULLY WORKING!
âœ… ESTABLISHED: Mandatory regression test for direct execution
ðŸ“‹ NEXT PHASE: Fork/exec implementation and validation
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before proceeding with ANY fork/exec work, we MUST:
1. âœ… Confirm direct execution test passes consistently on every boot
2. ðŸ“‹ Run additional validation to ensure no regressions in syscall infrastructure
3. ðŸ“‹ Only then proceed to fork/exec implementation

### Immediate Next Steps - START HERE FOR NEW SESSION

1. **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Implement Proper Page Table Isolation**
   - **Current Bug**: Processes share L3 tables, causing "already mapped" errors
   - **Root Cause**: ProcessPageTable only copies PML4 entries, not deeper tables
   - **Solution**: Implement deep copying of page tables
   - **Steps**:
     a. Modify ProcessPageTable::new() to allocate new L3/L2 tables
     b. For each kernel PML4 entry, recursively copy table hierarchy
     c. Never share L3/L2/L1 structures between processes
     d. Test with multiple concurrent processes
   - **No Workarounds**: This is the only acceptable solution

2. **Document Current Memory Layout**
   - Analyze bootloader mappings to understand kernel placement
   - Document which PML4 entries contain kernel vs user mappings
   - Create memory map showing current layout issues

3. **Future: Higher-Half Kernel Migration**
   - Long-term goal: Move kernel to addresses >= 0xFFFF800000000000
   - Requires bootloader modifications
   - Will completely solve kernel/user address conflicts

**ðŸ“Š PHASE 8 COMPLETION ASSESSMENT:**
- **Fork System Call**: âœ… 100% - Complete with proper semantics
- **Exec System Call**: âœ… 100% - Fully functional program replacement

## Current Development Focus

### Immediate Priority: Disk I/O Foundation
Based on our discussion, the next major milestone is implementing disk I/O to enable dynamic program loading:

1. **Simple RAM Disk** - Store programs in memory to simulate disk
2. **Read-only FAT32** - Well-documented, good tooling
3. **ATA PIO Driver** - Simpler than AHCI, works in QEMU
4. **exec() from disk** - Load programs dynamically
5. **Remove static embedding** - No more include_bytes!

This will transform Breenix from a kernel with built-in programs to a true OS that can load and execute programs from storage.

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Infrastructure
- Shared QEMU runner for efficiency (~45 seconds for all tests)
- Integration tests with real kernel execution
- POST completion detection for test synchronization
- Visual testing mode with QEMU display
- Categories: Boot, Memory, Interrupts, Logging, Timer, System

### Testing Philosophy
- Write tests early in development cycle
- Test both success and failure cases
- Integration tests over unit tests for OS code
- Use feature flags for test-specific code paths
- Maintain fast test execution times

## Development Workflow

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT TESTING ðŸš¨

**NEVER commit without running the FULL test suite!**

**Before EVERY Commit:**
1. **Run the complete test suite**: `cargo test`
2. **Verify ALL tests pass**:
   - `test_divide_by_zero` - Exception handling
   - `test_invalid_opcode` - Exception handling
   - `test_page_fault` - Exception handling
   - `test_multiple_processes` - 5 concurrent processes
3. **Check test output details**:
   - `test_multiple_processes`: Must see 5 "Hello from userspace!" messages
   - Exception tests: Must see TEST_MARKER output
4. **If ANY test fails**: DO NOT COMMIT - fix the issue first
5. **When adding features**: ADD A TEST to the test harness

### Branch Strategy
- `main` branch for stable code
- Feature branches for all development
- Pull requests for code review
- Comprehensive commit messages
- Co-authorship credits (Ryan Breen + Claude)

### Code Quality Standards
- **Run `cargo test` after EVERY change**
- Zero compiler warnings policy
- Clean up dead code before merging
- Follow existing code patterns
- Document complex algorithms
- Safety comments for unsafe blocks

### Build System
- Custom x86_64-breenix target
- Separate targets for kernel and userspace
- Automated userspace program building
- UEFI and BIOS disk image generation

## Technical Decisions

### Memory Layout
```
Virtual Memory Map:
0x0000_0000_0000_0000 - 0x0000_7FFF_FFFF_FFFF : User space (128 TiB)
0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000 - 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF : Kernel space (128 TiB)

Physical Memory Offset: 0x28000000000 (provided by bootloader)

Process Memory Layout:
0x1000_0000 : Default program load address (256 MB)
0x5555_5555_4000 : User stack top (grows down)
```

### Interrupt/Syscall Mechanism
- INT 0x80 for system calls (Linux-compatible)
- Hardware interrupts via PIC (no APIC yet)
- Software interrupts for exceptions
- SWAPGS for kernel/user GS separation

### Scheduler Design
- Preemptive round-robin scheduling
- Timer-driven (1000Hz tick rate)
- Separate idle thread (ID 0)
- Integration with async executor
- Userspace thread priority over kernel tasks

## POSIX Compliance Tracking
