# Breenix OS Project Roadmap

This is the master project roadmap for Breenix OS. It consolidates all existing documentation and provides a unified view of completed work and future goals. This document is actively maintained and referenced during development.

## Current Development Status

### Recently Completed (Last Sprint)
- âœ… **MAJOR**: Fixed timer interrupt doom loop with terminated threads
- âœ… **MAJOR**: Fixed idle thread context switching and kernel mode transitions  
- âœ… **MAJOR**: Implemented proper thread cleanup without infinite loops
- âœ… Added fork() system call skeleton with thread ID debugging
- âœ… Enhanced timer interrupt handler to prevent userspace execution loops
- âœ… Added idle thread transitions with proper assembly context setup
- âœ… Implemented MCP server connectivity and HTTP API for programmatic testing
- âœ… Built comprehensive fork testing infrastructure (Ctrl+F, forktest command)
- âœ… Added scheduler improvements to handle terminated thread states properly

### Currently Working On (Phase 8: Enhanced Process Control)
- ðŸš§ **Timer scheduling aggressiveness** - Userspace threads get preempted too quickly
- ðŸš§ Fork() implementation ready but needs timer scheduling fix to test properly
- ðŸš§ Thread 3 starts userspace execution but immediately switches to idle thread 0
- ðŸš§ Need to adjust timer frequency or scheduling policy for userspace execution

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix aggressive timer scheduling** - Allow userspace threads to run before preemption
2. **Test fork() system call** - Verify thread ID tracking and basic functionality  
3. **Implement actual fork() logic** - Process duplication with copy-on-write memory
4. **Add wait()/waitpid()** - Process synchronization and zombie prevention
5. **Implement execve()** - Program replacement within existing process

### Threading Infrastructure Status âœ…
- **Timer Interrupt Loop**: FIXED - No more endless terminated thread warnings
- **Idle Transition**: FIXED - Proper kernel mode setup with idle_loop() function
- **Thread Cleanup**: FIXED - Terminated threads handled without infinite loops
- **Context Switching**: WORKING - Between userspace and kernel modes
- **Scheduler**: WORKING - But too aggressive with preemption timing

### Fork Implementation Status
- **System Call**: `sys_fork()` implemented in `kernel/src/syscall/handlers.rs:184-235`
- **Test Infrastructure**: Complete with Ctrl+F keyboard trigger and MCP commands
- **Current Behavior**: Returns fake PID 42, logs thread context for debugging
- **Threading Issue**: Userspace never runs long enough to call fork() due to aggressive scheduling
- **Next**: Fix timer scheduling to allow userspace execution, then test fork()

### Next Major Milestone
**Phase 11: Disk I/O** - Enable dynamic program loading from disk instead of embedding in kernel

### High-Interest Features
- **Serial Input** - Would enable remote control and automated testing
- **Network Stack** - The day we send our first ping packet will be epic! ðŸŽ‰

## Project Vision

Breenix is an experimental x86_64 operating system written in Rust, focusing on:

## Current Development Focus

### Immediate Priority: Disk I/O Foundation
Based on our discussion, the next major milestone is implementing disk I/O to enable dynamic program loading:

1. **Simple RAM Disk** - Store programs in memory to simulate disk
2. **Read-only FAT32** - Well-documented, good tooling
3. **ATA PIO Driver** - Simpler than AHCI, works in QEMU
4. **exec() from disk** - Load programs dynamically
5. **Remove static embedding** - No more include_bytes!

This will transform Breenix from a kernel with built-in programs to a true OS that can load and execute programs from storage.

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Infrastructure
- Shared QEMU runner for efficiency (~45 seconds for all tests)
- Integration tests with real kernel execution
- POST completion detection for test synchronization
- Visual testing mode with QEMU display
- Categories: Boot, Memory, Interrupts, Logging, Timer, System

### Testing Philosophy
- Write tests early in development cycle
- Test both success and failure cases
- Integration tests over unit tests for OS code
- Use feature flags for test-specific code paths
- Maintain fast test execution times

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` branch for stable code
- Feature branches for all development
- Pull requests for code review
- Comprehensive commit messages
- Co-authorship credits (Ryan Breen + Claude)

### Code Quality Standards
- Zero compiler warnings policy
- Clean up dead code before merging
- Follow existing code patterns
- Document complex algorithms
- Safety comments for unsafe blocks

### Build System
- Custom x86_64-breenix target
- Separate targets for kernel and userspace
- Automated userspace program building
- UEFI and BIOS disk image generation

## Technical Decisions

### Memory Layout
```
Virtual Memory Map:
0x0000_0000_0000_0000 - 0x0000_7FFF_FFFF_FFFF : User space (128 TiB)
0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000 - 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF : Kernel space (128 TiB)

Physical Memory Offset: 0x28000000000 (provided by bootloader)

Process Memory Layout:
0x1000_0000 : Default program load address (256 MB)
0x5555_5555_4000 : User stack top (grows down)
```

### Interrupt/Syscall Mechanism
- INT 0x80 for system calls (Linux-compatible)
- Hardware interrupts via PIC (no APIC yet)
- Software interrupts for exceptions
- SWAPGS for kernel/user GS separation

### Scheduler Design
- Preemptive round-robin scheduling
- Timer-driven (1000Hz tick rate)
- Separate idle thread (ID 0)
- Integration with async executor
- Userspace thread priority over kernel tasks
