# Cross-Compilation Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

Successfully resolved the ARM64 (Apple Silicon) to x86_64 cross-compilation issue that was preventing Breenix from building on macOS with Apple Silicon processors.

## Root Cause

The `x86_64` crate version 0.14.13 (used by bootloader dependencies) contained inline assembly with x86 registers (eax, edx, etc.) that were not guarded by architecture checks. When building on ARM64 hosts, this caused compilation failures.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Rust Toolchain Pin (Already Applied)
```toml
# rust-toolchain.toml
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly-2025-06-24"  # Pinned due to x86-interrupt ABI regression
```

### 2. Crate Version Patch (NEW)
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[patch.crates-io]
# Force the older x86_64 v0.14.13 to be replaced with v0.15.2 which has ARM-safe guards
x86_64 = { git = "https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64", tag = "v0.15.2" }
```

This forces all dependencies (including transitive bootloader dependencies) to use x86_64 v0.15.2, which properly guards x86-specific code with `#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]`.

### 3. Cargo Configuration
```toml
# .cargo/config.toml
[unstable]
bindeps = true  # Enable artifact dependencies
```

## Results

✅ Full workspace builds successfully on Apple Silicon
✅ QEMU runners compile and execute
✅ Kernel can be built for x86_64 target
✅ No Docker or VM required for development

## Build Commands

```bash
# Standard build (now works!)
cargo build

# Run UEFI mode
cargo run --bin qemu-uefi

# Run BIOS mode  
cargo run --bin qemu-bios

# Build just the kernel
cargo build -p kernel
```

## Future Considerations

1. When the x86-interrupt ABI regression is fixed in Rust nightly, update the toolchain
2. Consider updating bootloader to a newer commit that already uses x86_64 v0.15.2
3. The patch can be removed once all dependencies naturally update to v0.15.2+

## Technical Details

The fix works because x86_64 v0.15.2 added proper architecture guards:
- v0.14.13: Inline assembly not guarded, fails on non-x86 hosts
- v0.15.2: `#[cfg(all(feature = "instructions", target_arch = "x86_64"))]` guards

This allows the crate to compile on ARM64 hosts even though it will never execute there (it's only used in x86_64 target code).
